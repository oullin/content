### Ollin's Content

:sparkles: Every time you read a post on my blog, the **oullin/content** repository is where the words and ideas live. 
It holds all the Markdown files that are parsed into blog entries, complete with front matter for titles, dates, tags, and summaries.

:mag_right: Inside **oullin/content**, you’ll find:

* **Markdown files** (`.md`) organised by date or topic.
* **Front-matter** at the top of each file—YAML metadata that tells the site how to display the posts.
* An **Assets** folder for images or any files posts link to, if applicable.

:cactus: Think of **oullin/content** as the heart of the “Ollin” blog. The build process reads each markdown file, applies templates, and turns them into the pages we see.

:rocket: Feel free to clone **oullin/content**, add or edit markdown posts, and run the content build locally. If you spot a typo or have a new story to share, send a pull request and help grow the blog.

> This is where the mindful movement of “Ollin” truly comes alive, one request at a time.
