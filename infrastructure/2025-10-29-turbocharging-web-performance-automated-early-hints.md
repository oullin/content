# Turbocharging Web Performance: Automated HTTP 103 Early Hints in Our Latest Update

I am excited to announce a significant enhancement to my site infrastructure, implemented through a recent Pull Request ([PR #155: "feat: Add build-time Caddy early hints generation"](https://github.com/oullin/web/pull/155)). 
This update introduces automated generation of **HTTP 103 Early Hints**, a powerful web standard that dramatically improves the perceived loading speed and overall user experience of my website.

While the technical details might seem complex, the core idea is simple: **we're teaching our web server to give your browser a "head start" on loading critical parts of our site.**

### What Exactly Are Early Hints and Why Do They Matter?

Imagine you order a meal at a restaurant. Instead of waiting for the chef to finish preparing your dish, the waiter comes to your table and says, "The chef is just starting, but here's a glass of water and some bread while you wait." You feel like you're making progress, right?

Early Hints work similarly for your web browser:

* **Without Early Hints:** When you request a webpage, your browser waits for our server to process everything – fetch data, generate HTML – before it sends *anything* back. This can take a moment, during which your screen is blank. Only after receiving the full HTML can your browser begin discovering and downloading necessary files like stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript code.
* **With Early Hints:** Now, as soon as your browser sends its request, our server quickly sends a special, lightweight "103 Early Hints" message. This message acts like the waiter's "heads up," telling your browser: "Hey, I'm working on the main page, but in the meantime, you're definitely going to need *this* stylesheet and *that* JavaScript file. Go ahead and start downloading them now!"

This simple pre-fetching trick means that by the time your browser receives the full HTML, a lot of the critical resources it needs to render the page are *already downloaded or in progress*. The result is a page that appears much faster and feels more responsive.

### The Technical Magic: How We Made It Happen

The implementation of Early Hints involved a carefully orchestrated set of changes across our build and server configurations. Here’s a breakdown of the key pieces:

1.  **The Early Hints Generator Script:**
    * At the heart of this update is a specialised Node.js script (`build/scripts/generate-early-hints.mjs`).
    * **What it does:** After our website's code is compiled into its final form (a process called "building"), this script scans the generated `index.html` file. It intelligently identifies all critical assets:
        * **CSS Stylesheets:** Files that control the look and feel of the page.
        * **JavaScript Modules:** Code that powers interactive elements.
        * **Preloaded Resources:** Other important files explicitly marked for early loading.
    * **Smart Processing:** It cleans up file paths, ignores external links (like those from content delivery networks), and compiles a unique list of every essential resource.

2.  **Caddy Server Integration:**
    * We use Caddy as our high-performance web server. Caddy has built-in support for Early Hints.
    * **Dynamic Configuration:** The generator script doesn't just list resources; it translates them into specific `early_hint` directives that Caddy understands. These look like:
        ```caddy
        early_hint @oullin_early_hints Link "</assets/index.css>; rel=preload; as=style"
        ```
    * **Dedicated Snippet:** A new file, `caddy/snippets/early_hints.caddy`, was created. This file acts as a dynamic container. The script writes its generated hints into this file, specifically between designated `BEGIN` and `END` markers. This keeps our Caddy configuration clean and organised.
    * **Caddyfile Import:** Our main Caddy configuration files (`WebCaddyfile.internal`, `WebCaddyfile.local`) were updated to `import early_hints`. This tells Caddy, "Always load and use the directives from our `early_hints.caddy` file."

3.  **Automated Build-Time Execution:**
    * The most elegant part of this solution is its complete automation. We've integrated the Early Hints generation directly into our standard deployment pipeline.
    * **The `postbuild` Hook:** In our `package.json` file, we added a `postbuild` script. This is an npm (Node Package Manager) feature that automatically runs a specified command *immediately after* our main website `build` command finishes.
    * **Deployment Flow:**
        1.  During deployment, our system first `build`s the website.
        2.  Right after the build completes, the `postbuild` command kicks in.
        3.  This `postbuild` command executes our Early Hints generator script.
        4.  The script reads the freshly built `index.html` and updates the `caddy/snippets/early_hints.caddy` file with the latest resource hints.
        5.  Finally, the Caddy server starts up, loads its configuration, including the now up-to-date Early Hints snippet, and is ready to serve pages faster.

### The Impact: A Faster, Smoother Experience for Everyone

This new system ensures our web server always sends the most relevant and up-to-date Early Hints to your browser. You, as a user, will likely notice:

* **Quicker Perceived Load Times:** Pages will "paint" content to your screen faster.
* **Reduced Blank Screen Time:** Less time staring at an empty white page.
* **More Responsive Interactions:** Critical JavaScript becomes available sooner.

This improvement is a testament to our continuous effort to leverage modern web standards and optimise every aspect of our platform to deliver the best possible user experience. We believe these "early hints" will make a significant difference in how fast and fluid our website feels.
