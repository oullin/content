We all love a straightforward narrative. There is comfort in believing that the problems of today can be solved by returning to the habits of yesterday. But in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, relying on nostalgia isn't just intellectually lazy—it’s actively dangerous.

Recently, I encountered a perfect example of **"prejudice over-analysis"**: dismissing a data-driven argument without reading it because it conflicted with a deeply held, pre-existing moral narrative.

This interaction highlighted a critical challenge we face in modern society: the refusal to "embrace knowledge" when that knowledge forces us to abandon a comfortable worldview.


## The Trigger: A New Perspective on Screen Time

The discussion began with an article from _The Economist_ that challenges conventional wisdom about whom we should worry about in the digital age.

**The Link:** [Never mind your children’s screen-time, worry about your parents](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/10/23/never-mind-your-childrens-screen-time-worry-about-your-parents?utm_campaign=shared_article)

Instead of engaging with the article's thesis—that the demographic crisis in digital literacy has shifted to the elderly—the response I received immediately pivoted to a familiar, nostalgic lament.


**The Feedback Received:**

> "I don't have the economist, but based purely on the title, it seems like the wrong debate. The issue is less screens themselves and more whether our digital spaces are safe for kids, and whether we want a society where we keep giving our time to
> tech billionaires and media moguls, all fueling overconsumption and desire (from advertisers, influencers, etc). It's not the backbone of a healthy society, in my humble opinion. Few things are sadder than seeing a family out to dinner, with the kids watching their iPads and the parents on their phones.
> What happened to spending quality time together? Playing board games? Reading books?"


## Why This Feedback is Radical and Invalid

On the surface, this feedback seems wholesome. Who doesn't want "quality time"? But when analysed critically, this response is both **radical** and **invalid**.

It is **radical** because it uses an emotional, reactionary stance (nostalgia for board games) to shut down a necessary conversation about a massive new societal vulnerability.

It is **invalid** because it critiques a thesis it hasn't read, effectively choosing to "avoid knowledge" to maintain a static view of the world. As an engineer committed to continuous evolution, I recognise this as a failure to update one's "mental software" with new data.

By focusing on the "iPad kid" narrative from 2010, the commenter ignores the 2025 data. Here is why that approach is fundamentally flawed.


#### 1\. The Data Reality: The Risk Has Shifted Upward

The feedback dismisses the article as the "wrong debate" and pivots back to "safe for kids." The data show that the article addresses the exact proper debate. While children have digital guardrails (parents, schools), the elderly are entering a "digital Wild West" unprotected.

- **The Data Point:** Research published by Princeton and NYU found that users over 65 shared **seven times as many articles from fake news domains** as the youngest age group. They are the primary targets of sophisticated AI voice-cloning scams and financial fraud.
- **Source:** [Fake news on Facebook is a 65-plus phenomenon (The Verge)](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18174631/fake-news-facebook-sharing-65-plus-age-study)
- **The Takeaway:** Ignoring the digital vulnerability of the generation with the most wealth and political power to complain about kids at dinner is a massive strategic error.
    

#### 2\. The Nostalgia Trap: The "Golden Age" Myth

The feedback asks, _"What happened to playing board games?"_ This relies on a "Golden Age" fallacy—mourning a past standard of living that never truly existed.

-   **The Data Point:** The isolated "nuclear family" sitting around playing Monopoly was a historical anomaly lasting roughly from 1950 to 1965. For most of human history, families lived in dense, extended clusters with grandparents, aunts, and cousins providing constant social interaction. The modern "sadness" of a family on phones isn't just because of "tech billionaires"; it's the result of a structural collapse of community support.   
-   **Source:** [The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake (The Atlantic)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/)
-   **The Takeaway:** Clinging to a 15-year blip of history as the eternal standard for human behaviour prevents us from understanding the structural issues of today.
    

#### 3\. The Psychology of Stagnation

Finally, the feedback demonstrates the danger of a fixed mindset. It rejects a new variable (elderly screen addiction) because it doesn't fit the established model ("tech is bad for kids").

This is the opposite of growth. In engineering, optimisation requires acknowledging every new variable. In life, it’s no different. Additionally, studies show that excessive nostalgia can actually hinder personal growth, keeping individuals stagnant by making them too attached to memories to embrace present reality.


## Conclusion: Embrace the Evolution

The danger of the feedback I received isn't just that it was factually wrong. The danger is that it encourages **societal stagnation**.

If we continue to fight the battles of the last decade—worrying only about "iPad kids"—we leave the door wide open for the crises of this decade: the radicalisation, financial exploitation, and isolation of our elders.

Real growth requires the courage to let go of comforting myths about the past and engage with the messy, complex data of the present. Evolution isn't optional; it's the only way to stay safe.
