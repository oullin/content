# When a Real-Time Feature Store Is the Wrong Fix for Fraud: A Practical Guide

**TL;DR:** Training–serving skew happens when the data or logic used to train a model does not match what is used in production. A real-time feature store can help with freshness and consistency, but it is not a cure-all. 
Before adding new infrastructure to your risk decision loop, prove that freshness moves the business needle, eliminate semantic skew, and start with the smallest possible surface area.


## What is ML in plain English

Machine learning is software that learns patterns from data. Instead of hard-coding rules, we train a model on examples, which it then uses to predict outcomes for new cases.

- **Example:** A spam filter learns from labelled emails.
- **In fraud:** The model learns from past transactions and labels such as fraud or not fraud.


## Mapping ML to a fraud system

- **Inputs (features):** amount, currency, device ID, IP, geolocation, BIN, merchant ID, account age, and attempts in the last 15 minutes.
- **Label:** fraud or not fraud. Accurate fraud labels often arrive much later due to chargebacks and disputes.
- **Model:** binary classifier outputs a risk score from 0 to 1.
- **Decision:** approve, step-up, or send to manual review.
- **Training–serving skew:** what the model saw during training does not match what it sees live.

## Where a feature store fits

- **Offline feature store (batch side):** point-in-time joins for reproducible training data, backfills, and consistent experiments.
- **Online feature store (serving side):** low-latency access to a *small* set of fast-changing features, such as rolling counts by device or IP, with short TTLs.

> Rule of thumb: keep only the truly hot features online. Everything else can stay batch.

## Typical online request flow

```
Client → Risk Gateway
        → Fetch hot features (rolling counts: device, IP, account)
        → Model Server (same transforms as offline)
        → Decision: approve / step-up/manual review
        → Log features + score + decision for audit & retraining
```

## When a real-time feature store is a **bad idea**

1) **Skew is semantic, not freshness**  
Training and serving compute features differently: null handling, defaults, time windows, or code paths.  
**Fix:** one shared transform library, data contracts, and golden tests that compare offline and online outputs on the same examples.

2) **Labels arrive late**  
Fraud labels may lag by 30–90 days. Faster features do not fix delayed learning.  
**Fix:** correct for label latency, consider two-stage decisions, and design experiments that account for delayed feedback.

3) **Feature half-life is long**  
If your strongest signals change slowly (e.g., KYC status, tenure, merchant tier), a daily batch is sufficient.  
**Heuristic:** If moving to minute-level features raises the AUC (Area Under the Curve) or cost-adjusted precision by less than ~0.5 percentage points, skip the complexity.

4) **The bottleneck is elsewhere**  
Most latency may be in network calls, cold starts, or model I/O.  
**Fix:** optimise serving, add warm pools, prefetch, quantise, or distil the model.

5) **Stateful, high-cardinality aggregates with late events**  
Exact real-time counts under out-of-order delivery are challenging to operate and prone to error.  
**Fix:** micro-batch windows, streaming with watermarks, or relaxed accuracy.

6) **Compliance and governance risk**  
An online store that carries PII (personal information, including privacy laws and data protection) across regions increases PCI scope and on-call burden.  
**Fix:** nail lineage, deletion, residency, and audit before adding hot-path dependencies.

7) **You need time-travel more than freshness**  
Fraud science requires “what was known at the time of the decision”. This is an offline correctness problem.  
**Fix:** point-in-time feature generation in the warehouse and consistent backfills.

8) **Data-contract rot**  
Upstream changes to enums or units break features. Centralising them does not solve the contract.  
**Fix:** strict versioned schemas and compatibility checks.

9) **You cannot meet the SLOs**  
If you cannot maintain tight p99 latency and high availability, a live PII store in the hot path is risky.  
**Fix:** embed the handful of hot features in a co-located cache with graceful fallbacks.

10) **Your real need is small**  
If only two or three features need freshness, a full platform is overkill.  
**Fix:** a scoped Redis cache or stream-to-cache pattern.

## A simple decision framework

1) **Prove freshness helps**  
Offline replay using event logs. Compare models with:
- T-0 features (event-time correct, micro-batch simulated)
- T-15 minutes
- T-24 hours

> Evaluate business metrics such as cost-weighted precision/recall and dollars saved per 1,000 transactions.

2) **Eliminate semantic skew first**  
- One transform library for offline and online.  
- Same nulls, same windowing, same defaults.  
- Golden tests that diffs feature vectors offline vs online on recent traffic.

3) **Start tiny**  
- Pilot a cache for one to three hot features.  
- Shadow log online values alongside offline recomputed values and track skew continuously.

4) **Governance before scale**  
Data contracts, PII handling, lineage, right to be forgotten, region boundaries, and access controls.

5) **Pre-define kill gates**  
Example: +1.5 pp precision at fixed recall, p99 under 20 ms, 99.99 availability. If not met, do not expand.

## Minimal architecture that works

- **Ingest:** payments and logins into an event stream.
- **Batch:** warehouse jobs compute point-in-time features for training and analysis.
- **Streaming:** micro-batch jobs maintain the few rolling counters that truly matter.
- **Online cache/store:** Redis or a managed key-value store for 5–20 hot features.
- **Model serving:** stateless service with warm pools and autoscaling.
- **Observability:** feature value logs, skew dashboards, drift alerts, end-to-end tracing.

## Metrics that matter

- **Quality:** precision, recall, approval rate, false positives by segment.
- **Cost-aware:** expected loss vs revenue saved at the chosen operating point.
- **Ops:** p99 decision latency, feature cache hit rate, online feature availability, fallback usage.
- **Governance:** lineage coverage, deletion time for PII, audit completeness.

## Common anti-patterns to avoid

- Training used signals not available at decision time.
- Event-time windows offline, processing-time windows online.
- Offline imputer fills zero, online sends null.
- Huge offline joins that cannot be served online.

## A short starting plan

1) Run the offline freshness ablation.  
2) Ship a shared transform library and contracts.  
3) Pilot two or three hot features in a cache.  
4) Shadow compare and monitor skew.  
5) Only scale if you clear the kill gates.

## Closing thought

A real-time feature store is powerful, but it is not a silver bullet. Most wins come from getting time semantics right, unifying transforms, and proving that freshness changes outcomes in dollars. Start small, measure, and only then add complexity.
