> **TL;DR:** Bugs are inevitable. Fixing everyone is not always the best way to create useful software: Prioritise impact, adoption, and user experience alongside defect counts.

Disappointment arises when expectations don't align with reality, especially in the realm of. The prevalence of bugs in software often leads to continuous frustration and even anger among users. 
However, it's essential to have a more formal and concise perspective on this matter.

The most reliable way to ensure impeccable software quality is by writing less software that performs fewer functions and dedicating ample time to refining that limited scope. Unfortunately, this approach 
is rarely compatible with achieving commercial success or satisfying programmer motivations. For example, the market's reception of a product that reduces features to minimise bugs would not be enthusiastic.

Bugs are an inevitable byproduct of software development, and while various techniques promise to reduce their occurrence, complete eradication is not feasible. Understanding this fact is crucial to 
comprehending why fixing every bug may not always be the top priority. Bug-free software does not guarantee usefulness, and software with bugs can still possess significant value.

Therefore, it is crucial to consider other factors, such as problem-solving capabilities, existing adoption, integrations, brand recognition, and user enjoyment, when assessing the value of software. 
Software organisations prioritise their backlog of bugs based on the number of affected users and the severity of the issue. It is not feasible to address every bug immediately, and more extensive software packages often have many open bugs, which is a regular occurrence.

In conclusion, adopting a more formal and concise approach to software quality necessitates acknowledging the inevitability of bugs and recognising that their absence is merely one aspect of success. 
Recognising the complexities involved in software development and the factors determining software value can help foster a more rational perspective among users and developers.


## Why disappointment happens

Disappointment often arises when expectations fail to align with reality, particularly in the realm of software. The prevalence of bugs can frustrate and even anger users. A more formal, concise perspective helps set healthier expectations.

> **Reality check:** Perfect software is rare. Useful software is achievable.

## Less can be better

The most reliable path to high quality is to build **less**: fewer features, a tighter scope, and more time spent refining.  
This rarely aligns with commercial pressures or developer motivations. Markets do not usually reward products that deliberately reduce features to minimise bugs.

## Bugs are normal, not fatal

-   Bugs are an **inevitable byproduct** of software development.
-   We can **reduce** them with solid practices, but **eradication** is not feasible.
-   Bug-free does not equal **useful**. Software with some bugs can still deliver **significant value**.


## How organisations actually prioritise

Teams triage issues to maximise value delivered:

1.  **Severity** and risk
2.  **Number of affected users**
3.  **Impact on key workflows**
4.  **Security or regulatory implications**
5.  **Effort and risk** to fix

Large, mature products often carry many open issues. That is normal and usually rational.


## What really defines value

When assessing software, look beyond the bug count:

-   Problem-solving capability.
-   Current adoption and momentum.
-   Integrations and ecosystem fit.
-   Brand recognition and trust.
-   User enjoyment and satisfaction.

These factors frequently outweigh the difference between “few bugs” and “very few bugs”.


## Conclusion

A pragmatic approach to quality acknowledges that bugs will exist and that their absence is only one dimension of success. Recognising the constraints, trade-offs, and broader value drivers leads to better decisions for both users and teams.


### Key takeaway

**Quality is multi-dimensional.** Strive for fewer bugs, but optimise for **usefulness, adoption, and user experience**.
