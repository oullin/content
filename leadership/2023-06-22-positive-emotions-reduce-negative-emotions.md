I grew up with constant reminders that no matter how bad things seemed, they could always be worse—scraped your knee? Well, hey, at least you didn't break your leg! Broke your leg? Well, it could have been worse, like cracking your skull and cracking your skull? Phew, lucky you didn't end up losing your life!

But it wasn't just about physical setbacks; it applied to social and mental challenges too—stuff that was within my control, as well as things entirely out of my hands. The secret to making it through those tough times and the inevitable suffering that life throws at you was to always keep in mind... it could be worse!

If you're familiar with positive emotions and reducing negative emotions, you'll recognise this mental fortification technique. It's like negative visualisation but with a different twist. The fundamental principle of Stoicism is that we often suffer more in our minds than in reality. And the key to true resilience is being able to control how we react to life's curveballs. Our reactions aren't set in stone; we can actually change them.

Man, I wish we had more of that mindset nowadays. More "it could be worse" and less "this is the worst thing ever." You know what I mean?
