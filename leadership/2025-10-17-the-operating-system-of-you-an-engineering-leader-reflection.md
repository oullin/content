As an engineer and a leader, my world is built on a foundation of continuous improvement. We refactor code, optimise queries, and streamline processes. We create roadmaps, plan sprints, 
and constantly iterate towards a better version of a product, a team, and ourselves. It’s a relentless, forward-moving pursuit of _more_. It’s about getting ready for the next release, 
the next challenge, the next version of you.

Then, I came across a video of Alan Watts that completely pulled the rug out from under this entire operating system. He calls his lessons "dangerous", and I now understand why. 
They don’t just challenge your assumptions; they decompile the very code you thought was "you," forcing a look at the fundamental, and perhaps unsettling, truth of your own source code.


## The Ego as a Social Construct: Our Professional API

Every morning, Watts says, we "put on our personality like we put on our clothes". For me, that’s the ‘Engineering Leader’ persona. It’s a role I step into, complete with its expected 
interfaces: strategic thinker, technical authority, mentor, and problem-solver. We spend enormous energy defending and promoting this character, this professional API we present to the world.

This constant maintenance is exhausting. It’s the source of imposter syndrome, the pressure to have every answer, and the anxiety of protecting our decisions. But Watts delivers a shocking 
revelation: this separate self, this carefully constructed persona, doesn't actually exist. It’s a social institution, a useful abstraction for navigating our careers, but it's not fundamentally real.

This hit me hard. How much of our leadership is about protecting this phantom self versus genuinely connecting with our teams? We build walls around this fictional identity with 
achievements and titles, but it’s a process that "never works". The real you isn't the title or the role; you are the entire system running underneath, an inseparable part of the 
universe you operate in. As Watts puts it, you are not a stranger in the universe; "you ARE the universe".


## The Tyranny of the Timeline: Decompiling Past and Future

Engineers live and die by timelines. Roadmaps, quarterly goals, and two-week sprints define our existence. We are perpetually focused on a future that, as Watts points out, "never actually comes". 
What arrives is always, and only, _now_.

We sacrifice the present—the only moment that truly exists—for an imaginary future. We get so caught up in "getting ready to live" that we forget actually to live. At the same time, 
we are shackled by the past. We carry our technical debt, our previous project failures, and our old habits around "like chains wrapped around you". We define our present capabilities 
by a past that is gone and exists only as a memory.

As a leader, I find this a profound insight. Are we creating a culture that is so focused on the next deadline and haunted by the last retrospective that we miss the magic of the present? 
The real work, the creative spark, the collaborative flow—it all happens _now_. The future is just a concept, a thought happening in this very moment. By constantly chasing it, we are like 
the donkey chasing a carrot that is eternally attached to its own head.


## The Paradox of Self-Improvement as an Infinite Loop

The tech industry is the undisputed champion of self-improvement. Learn the new framework, get the certification, and read the leadership books. The entire culture is built on becoming a 
better version of yourself. But Watts asks a disarmingly simple question: "Who is trying to improve whom?"

He argues that it is the ego trying to improve the ego, the "I" trying to make "me" better. In programming terms, this is an infinite loop, a recursive function with no base case. 
The very act of trying to "fix" yourself reinforces the illusion that you are fundamentally broken or incomplete.

What if we are already whole? What if the problem isn’t that we need to _become_ something, but that we _think_ we need to?. This completely reframes my approach to team development. 
Instead of pushing my team to constantly "improve", what if my role is to help strip away the external pressures and anxieties so they can access the complete, capable person who is already 
there? The goal shifts from fixing what's broken to revealing what's already whole.


## Seeing Life as a Process, Not a Project

Projects have a destination. There's a launch date, a finish line. We’re taught to treat life this way—as a series of goals to be achieved. But Watts suggests a different model. Life, 
he says, is not a journey with a destination; "it's a dance, a play, a musical thing". You don’t listen to a symphony to get to the final note; the point is the music itself, moment by moment.

This is a radical idea for anyone in a results-driven field. But it resonates. The deepest satisfaction in engineering doesn't just come from the successful deployment. It comes from 
the process: the beauty of an elegant algorithm, the synergy of a team in flow, the "aha!" moment of solving a complex bug.

The meaning of our work is not just in the destination, but in the dance of creation itself.

This perspective is "dangerous" because it makes you "ungovernable". When you stop chasing the phantom carrots of society—more money, a better title, the next big thing—you become free. 
You start operating from a place of authenticity and presence. As a person and a leader, I can't think of a more powerful system upgrade than that.
