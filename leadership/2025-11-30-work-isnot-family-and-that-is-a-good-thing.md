# Work Isn't a Family—and That's a Good Thing

The phrase “we’re like family here” gets thrown around in workplaces, but I’ve never liked it. It’s rarely true. Often, it’s used to encourage employees to sacrifice their boundaries. The message is subtle but clear: prioritise the company, even on weekends or during your time off. However, when the company needs to downsize or shift priorities, those same employees realise that the loyalty they gave isn’t returned.

The problem with calling work a “family” is that it requires a deep personal commitment, yet offers no emotional safety that real families provide. In a true family, love and support are unconditional. That’s never the case at work. And that’s fine—because work shouldn’t be a family. Most people don’t want that anyway. They already have families. They seek trust, collaboration, fairness, and the opportunity to engage in meaningful work.

## So, what’s a better metaphor?

[Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture#dream-team) framed it best: work is a professional team. On a team, everyone has a role. You earn your spot by demonstrating your ability to deliver results and support the team’s mission. And just as significantly, if you can’t hold that role—if the fit isn’t right—you may be cut, not out of spite but because teams have to perform.

This idea isn’t cold. It’s clear. It sets expectations and allows for fairness. You can’t demand excellence without also being honest about performance. And you can’t claim to run a professional team while keeping people in roles they can’t fulfil just because they’re friendly or have been around a long time.

**Look at sports:** millions of people play soccer, but only a few play at the top level. Even if you’re outstanding, there may still be a better fit elsewhere. Top clubs in Europe only have eleven starting spots. It doesn’t mean you’re bad if you're not quite there—it means you’re not in the right place.

And if someone isn’t ready for that high level, keeping them there is unfair. The pressure will be intense, their weaknesses will show, and they’ll likely struggle to keep up. In that case, letting them go is an act of respect—not punishment.

Of course, managers should stretch people. Give them chances. But also observe: is the person stepping up? Are they making progress? Or are they overwhelmed? If there’s no improvement after a fair shot, it’s time to take action. That’s part of what it means to lead.

Leadership isn’t just about support—it’s also about standards. Being in charge means making tough decisions, often with incomplete information. But it’s necessary to act if you want your team to thrive.

Not everyone needs to be on the elite team. But everyone deserves to be on a team where they belong. That makes work meaningful—not fake family ties, but collaboration with people who want to win together.
